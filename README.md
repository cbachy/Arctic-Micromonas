Data repository for Bachy et al. paper on quantitative assessments of Micromonas in the Fram Strait

>pr2_filtered_16S_cdhit_Stram.fasta is a sequence file with the 832 clustered (CD-HIT 99%) Stramenopile PR2 plastidial 16S sequences that were used to build the RAxML tree for phylogenetic placement of the V1-V2 16S rRNA Illumina amplicon.

>RAxML_bipartitions.Stramenopiles_16S_PR2_GTRGI_17sep21.nwk is the reference RAxML tree used to phylogenetically place the stramenopile V1-V2 16S rRNA Illumina amplicons from Fram Strait seawater and sediment trap samples described in the paper (Bachy et al., 2022) using EPA-ng. 1294 positions were considered, model of evolution (GTR+G) with 500 BS replications.
